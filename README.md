# FL Studio API Docs

This repository contains automatically generated documentation for the FL Studio Python API.

## How it works

The documentation is generated from my [FL Studio API Stubs](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/FL-Studio-API-Stubs)
using [pdoc](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc) to create a static HTML website.
